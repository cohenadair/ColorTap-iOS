        <h1>Tapd Privacy Policy</h1>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Tapd ("us", "we", or "our") operates an app for Android
            and iOS (the "App") under the same name.  This page informs you 
            of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of data we 
            receive from people using the App ("User").
        </p>
        <p>
            By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in
            accordance with this policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            This policy applies to App versions x.y.y, where "x" is any number greater than or 
            equal to 2, and "y" is any number.
        </p>

        <h3>Information Gathered</h3>
        <p>
            The following section describes data gathered by the App, and may not apply to
            external libraries used within the App ("Third Parties").  Please review the
            "Third Parties" section of this document for Privacy Policies on individual Third
            Parties used in the App.
        </p>
        <h4>Network & Internet</h4>
        <p>
            The App does not require a valid network or internet connection to function; however,
            the following features do require a valid network connection:
            <ul>
                <li>In-app purchases</li>
                <li>Rewarded ads</li>
            </ul>
            In addition, certain Third Parties utilize the internet in order to improve User
            experience. See the "Third Parties" section of this policy for more information.
        </p>
